## Intro to Redbean PHP

Wrote a quick intro (in Swedish) to the [Redbean ORM](redbeanphp.com) on my website; [marcusolsson.me](http://marcusolsson.me/2014/01/28/intro-till-readbean-php).

This is just a repository for all the code used in the introduction article, nothing fancy and hardly useful in most circumstances on it's own.

Run `$ composer install` to download and install Redbean.
